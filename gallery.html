I truly love spending time with them,whether we are going out to eat together, exploring new places, or travelling as a group. But what I cherish the most is the simple joy of gathering in one place, laughing together as if there’s no tomorrow, and doing silly things with my cousins and siblings. These moments feel priceless because we know that one day, our different paths in life might make it harder for all of us to be together like this again. That is why it’s so important to enjoy every second we have now and surround ourselves with people who make us feel happy, loved, and understood.</b> <br><br>

	<b>Family is also the place we turn to for the comfort, the people we know we can rely on at any time, no matter what we are going through. That is why I feel the need to appreciate every moment with them while everyone is still here and still able to gather together. To me, family means love, support, warmth, and the feeling of belonging to a group that accepts you completely. And honestly, nothing feels better than being home, surrounded by the comfort of familiar faces and the cooking made with my mother’s love.</b></p>

	<p style="background-image: url(images/gridbeigebg.jpg); text-align: center; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: darkslategrey;" ><b>This year, I was lucky to meet many new friends through my internship, my travels, and the different experiences I went through. But what I appreciate the most are the friends who have stayed in touch with me even after SPM. Growing up has taught me that not everyone who was close to you in high school will remain in your life forever, and people naturally change as time goes on. That’s why I truly value the friends who are still by my side today. I enjoy meeting new people, sharing laughs, doing silly things, gossiping, and even facing serious moments together. Friends are the ones who support me when I want to <q>spill the tea</q> or when I’m dealing with a problem,they listen, they understand, and they show up for me. And I do the same for them. Real friendship feels like having a second family, and I’m grateful for every person who chooses to stay in my life.</b></p>

	<p style="background-image: url(images/gridbeigebg.jpg); text-align: center; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: darkslategrey;"><b>Travel is something I truly love, and if I had the money, I would rather spend it exploring new countries than buying unnecessary trendy things. What makes traveling so special to me is the chance to meet new people, get to know them, and learn about their culture, traditions, and food. I’ve met so many friendly and welcoming people in Indonesia, and honestly, it was really fun. I also enjoy the change of scenery like beautiful beaches, towering mountains, and places that feel completely different from home. One of my most unforgettable experiences was riding a hot air balloon in Cappadocia, Turkey with my mom. Even though it was expensive, it was definitely worth it for the memories we created together. I also got to try their original dishes and eat like a European people like fresh homemade cheese, pickles, tomato soup, kebab, and <abbr title="to be honest">tbh</abbr>, everything tasted good even though I’m a picky eater. I also love traveling to learn history about different countries. For example, when I visited Vietnam, I learned about their history with America and even visited the very first letter post in the country. Traveling teaches me so much about the world, and every trip becomes a memory I keep forever.</b></p>
